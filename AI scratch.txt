split [Traditional features, Technical Features] into train, test datasets

scale feature training and feature testing data using MinMaxScalar

reshape scaled training and testing data into 3D datasets

create LSTM model:
	add 5 LSTM layers, 200 nodes each
	add 5 Dropout layers, 20% dropout
	add 1 LSTM layer, 200 nodes
	add 1 Dropout layer, 50%
	add 1 Dense output layer, 1 node
